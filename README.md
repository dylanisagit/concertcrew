# Welcome to the Concert Crew template

## Project info

This website template allows you to establish a public-facing site with a password-protected admin console. The website hosts a list of upcoming concerts (or any events, really) that you are potentially interested in attending. The admin console allows you to add and modify the status of any of those events - for example, if you bought tickets. Share the website with your fellow concert goers, where they can see the event list, listen to tracks from each of the artists, indicate their interest in attending, and start discussions about each show.
